This is a note I made to summarize things I had learnt with Cypress, knowledge only no practical in here

1. What is Cypress?
- One of the popular tool for Web integration and End to End UI test automation.
- Built on Node.js and comes packaged as an npm module - uses JavaScript to write tests

2. What makes Cypress a unique tool?
- Delivers fast, consistent
- Flake Resistant - automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async issues
- Test edge cases by mocking the server response
- Debuggability - takes snapshots as our test run. Can hover on each command in the Command Log to see what happend at each step
- View videos of the execution of our entire tests when running from Cypress Dashboard

Some of the things are notable
- Relative naive (This talk about the community of Cypress)
- Cannot write with old language like C# and Java - using JS
- No support for multiple browser tabs or popups
- No shadow DOM support
- No support on native mobile apps, but it does intend to support mobileweb browsers

3. Cypress Architecture:
Most testing tools (like Selenium) operate by running outside of the browser and executing remote commands across the network
(^ Mainly about the webdriver need to apply before running)
-> Cypress directly operates inside the browser
(^ Cypress don't need them)
More details: Cypress Architecture part from this link: https://www.toolsqa.com/cypress/what-is-cypress/

Cypress Browser Support: Canary, Chrome, Electron (Default), Chromium, Mozilla Firefox browsers (beta support), Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) browsers

4. Cypress components - two main: Cypress Test Runner and Cypress Dashboard
(^ one of them is used as a runner to run our Cypress test cases on the local machine, and other tracks our runs and status from our Automation Suite)
- Test Runner:
  + Runs test in a unique interactive runner that allow us to see commands as they execute while also viewing the application under test
  + Key of subcomponents that should focus below:
    * Test status
    * Url Preview
    * Viewport Sizing
    * Command Log
    * App Preview
    -> Information: https://www.toolsqa.com/cypress/what-is-cypress/

- Dashboard Service:
  + Service that provides us access to recored tests - typically when running Cypress tests from our CI provider

5. Unique features provided by Cypress?
- Time Travel: It can take snapshots of the application when the tests are running. Then as a test developer, we can hover over each command in the Test Runner panel to see what happened at each step.
- Debuggability: It enables debugging of the tests directly from the familiar tools like Developer Tools. The readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
- Automatic Waiting: With Cypress, there is no need to put explicit waits or sleeps to your tests. It automatically waits for commands and assertions before proceeding.
- Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: Similar to unit test cases, you can verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers at run time using the spies and stubs provided by Cypress.
- Network Traffic Control:  Using Cypress, you can stub network traffic as you like and customize the response of your API calls as per your need.
- Consistent Results: As Cypress doesnâ€™t use Selenium or WebDriver and executes tests directly in the browser, it aids for fast, consistent, and reliable tests that are flake-free.
- Screenshots and Videos: It takes screenshots automatically on failure, or record videos of your entire test suite when running from the CLI.
